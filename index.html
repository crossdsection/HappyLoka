				Story about us
			</h2>

			<p align="justify" class="nino-sectionDesc">We are a group of dedicated yoga practitioners eager to share teachings of traditional Hatha Yoga.   We strive to guide an intelligently structured  yoga practice that focuses on the breath, not on perfecting the pose, and that prepares the student to sit in stillness and rejoice in the sweetness of meditation.
			<br><br>“The breath is the primary tool through which you will be able to access what’s actually happening in your body. It’s the primary tool to activate change in your structure at a deep level, and it’s the primary tool to link your conscious awareness to the process of change. So think of the breath as an internal ﬂashlight, microscope, viewfinder, that helps you discover what’s going on.” ~ Gary Kraftsow<br><br>

			We teach yoga as an inclusive path for transformation of Body, Mind & Spirit, that prepares you on the mat to succeed and thrive out in the world.

			All our teachers are Certified and have years of experience both practicing and teaching yoga in group and private settings.  We welcome the opportunity to have you in a group class or work with you privately to customize a practice that supports your Physical, Emotional & Energetic goals.

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">Hatha Yoga</h4>
								<p>Hatha yoga is a branch of yoga that emphasizes physical exercises to master the body along with mind exercises to withdraw it from external objects. The word haṭha means "force" in Sanskrit, and may have this association because the early Indians believed that its practice was challenging and "forced its results to happen" on the yogi. The term "Hatha yoga" connotes a system of supplementary physical techniques within the broader concept of Yoga.</p>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">Vinyasa Yoga</h4>
								<p>Vinyasa is a style of yoga characterized by stringing postures together so that you move from one to another, seamlessly, using breath.  Commonly referred to as “flow” yoga, it is sometimes confused with “power yoga“.

Vinyasa classes offer a variety of postures and no two classes are ever alike.  The opposite would be “fixed forms” such as Bikram Yoga, which features the same 26 postures in every class, or Ashtanga which has the same sequence every time.

The variable nature of Vinyasa Yoga helps to develop a more balanced body as well as prevent repetitive motion injuries that can happen if you are always doing the same thing every day.</p>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">Sivananda Yoga</h4>
								<p>Sivananda yoga, after teachings of Swami Sivananda, is a non-proprietary form of hatha yoga in which the training focuses on preserving the health and wellness of the practitioner. The Sivananda training system aims to retain the vitality of the body and decrease chance of disease, by simply and naturally cultivating the body. The system philosophies are summarized in 5 principles.
									<ul style="color:black" >
										<li>Proper exercise: Asanas</li>
										<li>Proper breathing: Pranayama</li>
										<li>Proper relaxation: Savasana</li>
										<li>Proper diet: Vegetarian.</li>
										<li>Positive thinking and meditation: Vedanta and Dhyana</li>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">Yin Yoga</h4>
								<p>Yin yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga with postures, or asanas, that are held for longer periods of time—for beginners, it may range from 45 seconds to two minutes; more advanced practitioners may stay in one asana for five minutes or more.
									 Yin yoga poses apply moderate stress to the connective tissues of the body—the tendons, fascia, and ligaments—with the aim of increasing circulation in the joints and improving flexibility. A more meditative approach to yoga, yin aims at cultivating awareness of inner silence, and bringing to light a universal, interconnecting quality.</p>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">APM Yoga</h4>
								<p>As the acronym suggests APM is the thoughtful combination of Asana, Pranayama, and Meditation. It is a prudent blend of above three to achieve the desired objectives in case of a practitioner. The APM enables an instructor to choose such asanas, breathing techniques and systems of meditation as are suitable to enhance the strength, stamina, harmony, and calmness for the practitioner.</p>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">Core Hatha</h4>
								<p>HATHA CORE are balanced Hatha Yoga classes with a specific core focus.
									 Physically, your core is your power centre: it is the area of your abdomen, back, buttocks, upper hamstrings, pelvic floor, and hip flexors.
									 Learn how each posture can be a “core” posture and how moving at a slower pace can help build core strength, awareness and stability. Explore how breath can support and strengthen the core as well.</p>

								<p>"I started my yoga practice when a friend suggested me to try Iyengar yoga class in koramangala in 2011 .I had no knowledge of  yoga actually .I was always in fitness regime my favourite was jogging and aerobics. Yoga classes would help me to relax and de-stress after jogging and aerobics. I had constant  thought of achieving or doing something in life rather than being just a home maker .So my passion for fitness made me think of becoming a yoga teacher .I was not sure if I could actually become a teacher. But thanks to yoga .It has helped me overcome all my weakness and gave me confidence, strength in all ways physical,spiritually and emotionally.  I have overcome all challenges.
								I did my TTC 200  and RPYT in 2013.Also did RPYT (Prenatal Yoga) .
								My practice has deepened my yoga experience of spirituality and feel connected  to all  beings .
								Yoga is everything for me .My inward  journey has began . Only way out is in."</p>

								<p>"Ramya first stumbled across yoga when the company she was working at introduced lunch-time yoga classes for its employees and was captivated from her first class itself. She studied Computer Science and worked in the animation industry for a while, but a restless search for something more slowly led her through a variety of different hobbies and fields of study. In the midst of this rollercoaster, yoga gave her a calm, steady inner self. Her curiosity eventually led her to the RYT 200 Teacher Training Course, where she started developing a deeper understanding of yoga.
								She understands the huge role yoga can play in physical and mental health and fitness and that reflects in her classes. Her classes go along the lines of her personal Sadhana so she can draw upon her own experience and insight to achieve a balance between what her students need and what they want. Her goal is to help practitioners explore their own yoga practice and use it to connect with their body, mind, and breath. Yoga, she believes, is the path to a happier self and a deep sense of well-being and peace.
								Apart from yoga, Ramya's interests include theatre, literature, and writing. She has a passion for music and spends hours playing and listening to music. She also loves traveling and is an avid trekker and photographer."</p>
